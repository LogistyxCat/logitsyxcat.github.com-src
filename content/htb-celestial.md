Summary: Guide to Celestial from Hack the Box, featuring a Node.js deserialization attack.

## Preamble

The original writeup I did for this was some time ago. My methodology then didn't include nearly as many images, and the box has been retired since August 2018.  <s>If I had the option to redo this with better notes and images to create a better product here, I absolutley would.</s>

Edit 2020-02-05:  I will be redoing this box sometime in the future.

## Description

The attack path for Celestial involves a deserialization attack against the hosted Node.js Express server, followed by some automated script hijacking.

Celestial's lab IP is `10.10.10.85`.

## Reconnaissance

The first thing I did was perform a scan of the host to determine what services were open, finding that only HTTP on port `3000` was available, which appeared to be a Node.js Express application.

Investigating the web page, the first thing display was a 404 error, but reloading the webpage revealed a different response, with the text __Hey Dummy, 2 + 2 = 22__.

Proxying my traffic through Burp suite revealed a base64 encoded cookie, with attributes including __username__, __country__, __city__, and __num__. Some research revealed that this Node.js application may be susceptible to a deserialization attack.

After some experimentation, I successfully generated a payload that would exploit the vulnerability.

After replacing my original cookie with the Base64 encoded tampered cookie, I got a reverse shell and the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation

Now I have access to the box as user `sun`, who is part of the `sudo` users group.  I did not attempt to see if there were any alternate paths.

Of immediate interest was the file output.txt which has a creation time within the last 5- or 10-minute time increment and the contents `Script is running....`.

After some observation, the creation time increments every 5 minutes exactly, indicating an automated process. The contents of the file match the contents of the `echo "Script is running..."` line from a file called `script.py` under the `Documents/` directory. Modifying the script to output a different string also modified the output files contents.

I created a Python reverse shell and placed my code into script.py and set a listener on Kali. At the next 5-minute mark, my code executed and gave me another reverse shell and the root flag.
